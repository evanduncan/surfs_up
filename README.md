## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to produce weather summary statistics given a large set of climate data.


## Results

While the weather in Hawaii in December and June differ less than one might think, there are a few main differences between the weather in the two months
- The range of temperatures in Hawaii during December is wider than that in June. The maximum temperatures are close to each other at 83 degrees in December and 85 in June but the minum temperatures differ more with the low in December being 56 and in June being 64.
- The variability of temperature is larger in December than in June as we can see by looking at the standard deviation (3.75 vs 3.25).
- Evan though the average temperatures are close for the two months, you can see that the lower 3 quarters of days are colder than the median temperature in June.

## Summary

These results show us that there are differences in Hawaiian weather throughout the year just not all that significant of differences, relative to most parts of the mainland U.S. Other queries that would give us useful information include an analysis of rainfall measurements throughout the year and also of humidity measurements. These would give us a more clear picture of the island's climate.
